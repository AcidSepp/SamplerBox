# Install

SamplerBox works with the RaspberryPi's built-in soundcard, but it is recommended to use a USB DAC (PCM2704 USB DAC for
less than 10â‚¬ on eBay is fine) for better sound quality.

+ download SamplerBox:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acidsepp/SamplerBox.git
cd SamplerBox
```

+ Setup Python 3.13.4:

```sh
pyenv install 3.13.4
pyenv local 3.13.4
```

+ setup venv

~~~sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
~~~

+ install

```sh
pip install -e .  
```

+ run

```sh
python3 samplerbox.py
```

Play some notes on the connected MIDI keyboard, you'll hear some sound!
