[Install](#install)
----

1. Check if the required tools are installed (see [Requirements](#requirements) below).

2. Run `sudo python setup.py build_ext --inplace` just once.

3. Run the soft with `python samplerbox.py`.

4. Play some notes on the connected MIDI keyboard, you'll hear some sound!  

  *Important note: it's not going to work with RaspberryPi's built-in soundcard: it will produce bad sound quality, and more annoying: lags/jitter. You do need a DAC such as [this one](http://www.ebay.fr/itm/1Pc-PCM2704-5V-Mini-USB-Alimente-Sound-Carte-DAC-decodeur-Board-pr-ordinateur-PC-/231334667385?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_71&hash=item35dc9ee479) to have normal audio output.*

*(Optional)*  Modify `samplerbox.py`'s first lines if you want to change root directory for sample-sets, default soundcard, etc.

[Requirements](#requirements)
----

You first need a RaspberryPi 2 (untested on RaspberryPi B / B+) and a DAC (i.e. a better soundcard than the built-in one, it costs around [6â‚¬](http://www.ebay.fr/itm/1Pc-PCM2704-5V-Mini-USB-Alimente-Sound-Carte-DAC-decodeur-Board-pr-ordinateur-PC-/231334667385?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_71&hash=item35dc9ee479)).

Assuming you are using a Raspbian distribution, you can install the required dependecies this way:

* Python-related packages and audio libraries:

  ~~~
  sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get -y install python-dev cython portaudio19-dev
  ~~~

* RtMidi-python for MIDI input and PyAudio for audio output:

  ~~~
  git clone https://github.com/superquadratic/rtmidi-python.git ; cd rtmidi-python ; sudo python setup.py install ; cd .. ;
  git clone http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/git/pyaudio.git ; cd pyaudio ; sudo python setup.py install ; cd ..
  ~~~

  *Note:* Don't install `pyaudio` with `apt-get install python-pyaudio` since this would install version 0.2.4, that wouldn't work for this project. Version 0.2.8 or higher is required.

  <!-- wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/python-pyaudio/python-pyaudio_0.2.8-1+b1_armhf.deb ; dpkg -i python-pyaudio_0.2.8-1+b1_armhf.deb -->  

[How to use it](#howto)
----

####1) How to change preset?

Use the buttons you connected to the RaspberryPi's GPIO (as described [here](http://www.samplerbox.org/makeit/)) or send a *Program Change* message with your MIDI keyboard.

####2) How to create a new sample-set?

* First create a new folder beginning with a number (in the range 0-127) + a white space. Example: `3 Grand piano/` or `14 Mellow organ/`
* Put some .WAV files in it. If their name are `%midinote.wav` (example: 36.wav, 37.wav, ..., 60.wav for middle C of the keyboard), there's nothing else to do!
* *(Optional)* If the filenames of the .WAV files are more complex, create a *sample-set definition file* in the sample-set folder, like this: `3 Grand piano/3.txt`. More details soon.
